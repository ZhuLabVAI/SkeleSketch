Works: ~70-90% of cases
Accuracy: ~60-90% of cases

Method:
Attempt 1 - Combine various partial skeletons to get an accurate image
Attempt 2 - Combine various partial blobs to get an accurate image

Issues:
- Connection of skeleton:
	- Overlapping of endpoints result in random new endpoints when merging (incorrect connection)
	- Random noise gets implemented due to being placed between useful aspects of the skeleton
- Usability:
	- Fixed to one base image currently, could result in even worse results from slight changes in image detail (pixel values / quality)
- Still unable to get various aspects of detail
	- Blurring removes clear details
	- Unable to grab hard to see details
